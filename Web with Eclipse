# How to run web with Eclipse:

1)Check the version of java in your system
2)Download Apache tomcat server zip based on the version
Mine is 8.5 so i used the below link to download the zip:
https://downloads.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.57/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.57-windows-x64.zip.asc
3)Extract the zip into a folder
4)Open Eclipse ->Java EE Environment->Servers in the bottom->click and add Tomcat server
5)If u get any errors regarding port numbers click on tomcat server and change the port number to a some random number
6)Finally Create a New Project

File->Other->Web->Dynamic Web Project->Project Name(Our wish)->finish

File is created
7)Create a new html file in web repo and start working and run the code as Tomcat Server.
8)Done


Prerequisites for servelet:

1.Go to Eclipse->New->Create a Dynamic Project
2.Web Content->Right click->Create html file->start writing the code
3.Go to this path mentioned below:

// Inorder to store the contents into a database we need to add lib package
 
C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\10.2.0\server\jdbc\lib\
There you will find a file named "ojdbc14"  copy that file and come to the eclipse workspace
Go to the Project which was created earlier->Web Content->WEB INF->lib->paste that file named ojdbc in that path.

4.To run the servelet->We need to do the below process:
java Resources->src->servelet->class name as register->finish

5.Adding Build path after creating the class , we will see some errors regarding dependencies which means library packages,
so inorder to overcome that we need to do the following procedure:

src->build path->configure Build path->libraries->external jars->tomcat server->lib->servelet-api->apply and close

6.Run the code and see the output


Sample code which i had written for a login page:


html code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="ISO-8859-1">
<title>Login page</title>
</head>
<body>
<form name="f1" action="Register" method="post">
Username:<input type="text" name="user"><br>
email:<input type="text" name="email"><br>
<input type="submit" value="Register">
